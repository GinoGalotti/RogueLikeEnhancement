# RogueLikeEnhancement
I'm doing this in a way to learn basics of Game design, improve my C# expertise and my general coding skills. My mantra is simple: make the project something that I'm proud to show, both as a game and as code itself. Obviously, I'm still learning as a programmer, and I've just started as a designer; so probably the things that you are going to see are probably not best industry practices.

If you have something to add, would change anything or just want to give some feedback; PLEASE, send me an email (ginogalotti@gmail.com). I would thank some advice!
